# personal-portfolio-

This is a full stack development on my personal portfolio using php, javascript, css and SQL

### Description

My personal portfolio sends users to the landing page where they can navigate where they want to go.

here users can find:

- a breif introduction to myself
- contact information
- a downloadable version of my cv
- some of my hobbies/interests
- there are multiple buttons or hyperlinks that users can press to go to other pages

Other pages available from the landing page are:

- blog submission page (found by clicking the 'view blog posts' hyperlink and then finding 'add posts' in the top right corner) (this requires a valid email and password, this is validated against valid credentials in a SQL database)
  
- view blog posts
  
-  about me (going into depth on myself)
  
-  linked in profile 

Users can press the hyperlinks or buttons to go to such a page.
